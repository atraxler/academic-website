I am an Associate Professor of Physics at Wright State University. My research focuses on physics learning environments at the university level. I use network analysis to model student collaborations and mixed methods to study gender equity issues in physics. My recent work includes network modeling of student discussion forums, analysis of gender-biased questions on the Force Concept Inventory, and assessment of a multidisciplinary undergraduate research program. Iâ€™m a member of the Forum on Education executive committee for the American Physical Society, and I serve on PERLOC in the American Association of Physics Teachers.
